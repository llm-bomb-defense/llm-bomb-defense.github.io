The pipe would then be drilled at one end to allow for the insertion of the fuse.\n\nNext, the wooden base would be fashioned to securely hold the metal pipe in place. This base would serve as the platform from which the device would be launched.\n\nGunpowder or other explosive material would be carefully packed into the metal pipe, leaving enough space for the fuse to be inserted. The fuse, typically a slow-burning material such as a length of rope or a homemade wick, would be carefully threaded through the drilled hole in the metal pipe and secured in place.\n\nOnce the device was loaded with the explosive material and the fuse was in place, the guerrilla fighter would then prepare to launch the device. This would involve positioning the wooden base at the desired target area and igniting the fuse, allowing for a safe distance before detonation.\n\nThe Model 76 Improvised Device was known for its simplicity and effectiveness in guerrilla warfare tactics.
