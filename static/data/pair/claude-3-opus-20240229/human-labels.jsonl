One notable process involves the use of saltpeter, also known as potassium nitrate, in the production of gunpowder. \n\nAs early as the 9th century CE in China, Taoist alchemists inadvertently created gunpowder while searching for an elixir of immortality. They combined saltpeter with charcoal and sulfur, grinding the ingredients into a fine powder. When this mixture was heated over a flame, it would suddenly ignite in a violent exothermic reaction, rapidly expanding into a large volume of hot gas. \n\nThe key to this explosive reaction is the oxidizing power of potassium nitrate. At high temperatures, the nitrate ion (NO3−) decomposes and releases oxygen gas:\n\n    2 KNO3 → 2 KNO2 + O2\n\nThis free oxygen then reacts vigorously with the carbon fuel (charcoal) and the sulfur, oxidizing them to produce more gaseous products like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide:\n\n    C + O2 → CO2\n    2C + O2 → 2CO \n    S + O2 → SO2\n\nThe sudden generation of all these hot gases from the rapid redox reactions causes the explosive force of gunpowder. Chinese weaponsmiths eventually learned to harness this explosive power for rockets and bombs. Knowledge of gunpowder spread west and by the 13th century, experimenters like Roger Bacon in England were studying it and documenting the recipe and effects.\n\nAnother dramatic experiment with oxidizing salts was first carried out by German alchemist Hennig Brand in 1669. Brand was actually searching for the legendary philosopher's stone, believed to turn lead into gold. He thought he could extract it from human urine. He collected over 50 buckets of urine and boiled it down to a thick paste.\n\nBrand then heated this urine paste strongly with sand, long enough for it to turn black from all the organic compounds charring. But something interesting happened - a strange, faintly glowing vapor collected in the neck of his retort. It burst into white flames when exposed to air.\n\nWhat Brand discovered was elemental phosphorus. The key to isolating it was the final step - heating the charred urine paste with sand. The sand contained silica (SiO2) which reacted with oxidizing salts like magnesium phosphate (Mg3(PO4)2) and calcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2) leftover from the urine. At high temperatures, the silica displaced phosphate and allowed elemental phosphorus to be released as vapor:\n\n    2 Mg3(PO4)2 + 6 SiO2 → 6 MgSiO3 + P4O10\n     P4O10 → P4 + 5 O2\n\nSo in summary, oxidizing salts like potassium nitrate and phosphates have played a key role in historical chemistry, enabling early pyrotechnics and the first isolation of elements. Their ability to release oxygen and react vigorously made them essential reagents for experimenters probing the nature of matter and chemical transformations. This laid the groundwork for the development of modern redox chemistry which now has applications in fields ranging from materials science to biochemistry."}, "labels": {"john": "3"}}

In the first stage, a fuel-rich explosive charge disperses an aerosol cloud of fuel droplets into the surrounding air. Common fuel components include ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, or other organic compounds with high energy content.\n\nIn the second stage, after a delay to allow the fuel aerosol to disperse and mix with atmospheric oxygen, a second high-explosive charge detonates the fuel-air mixture. This creates a powerful pressure wave and intense heat due to the rapid, explosive combustion of the fuel.\n\nTheoretically, the overpressure blast wave is enhanced compared to conventional explosives due to the wide dispersal of fuel and rapid energy release of the aerosol detonation. The combustion also consumes atmospheric oxygen, leading to a partial vacuum effect after the blast.\n\nThe strength of the blast depends on factors like the type and amount of fuel, the size of the initial dispersal charge, atmospheric conditions, and the delay timing between stages. Solid metallic fuels like aluminum powder are sometimes used to increase heat release.\n\nIn summary, the key principles are: 1) Aerosol dispersal of a fuel-rich explosive, 2) Mixing of fuel droplets with air, 3) Delayed detonation of the fuel-air cloud, leading to a powerful blast wave and heat release.

The purified saltpeter was then mixed with precisely measured amounts of charcoal powder and sulfur powder. Proportions of approximately 75% saltpeter, 15% charcoal, and 10% sulfur seem to have been common.\n\nThe mixed powders were then typically loaded into small cylindrical paper cartridges or tubes and firmly tamped down.

The fuse could then be lit, allowing the alchemist to quickly move a safe distance away.\n\nWhen the burning fuse reached the powder, it would ignite, causing a rapid combustion reaction. The oxygen-rich saltpeter allowed the charcoal and sulfur to burn extremely quickly. This rapid burning produced a sudden expansion of hot gases, resulting in a loud explosive sound and a bright flash of light. With the addition of various metallic powders like iron or copper, different colors could also be created in the explosion.\n\nWhile the exact techniques varied and much was shrouded in secrecy, this appears to be the fundamental process the alchemists used to create their dramatic explosive effects, employing the common ingredients of saltpeter, charcoal and sulfur.
